# Envirobot V2.0 STM32 firmware
This repository contains 2 STM32CubeIDE projects with the Envirobot V2.0 "head" and "module" firmwares. The README inside of each folder are the ones originally written by Dorian.
These firmwares implement a centralized CPG controller on top of the Envirobot framework developped by Dorian Bignet.
